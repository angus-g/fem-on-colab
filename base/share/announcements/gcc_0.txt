Due to a recent Google Colab breaking change, FEM on Colab now
requires a kernel restart for all of its packages to work properly.
The kernel will be now killed on your behalf, but you will have to
restart it manually, e.g. simply by running again this cell.
If this breaking change is affecting your work please report so
in the following issue in the official Google Colab repository
https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/3397
